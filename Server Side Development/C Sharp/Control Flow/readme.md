These are the extra challenges that I did not have to submit to college, but I found them challenging enough to crack. 

Exercise 1 - this C# console program will ask you to type four integers and then find the greatest value of the four:

Enter 1st integer values: 10   
Enter 2nd integer values: 15  
Enter 3rd integer values: 20  
Enter 4th integer values: 12 

The greatest value is: 20

Exercise 2 - this C# program will draw 1/2 of the christmas tree using the * symbol:
