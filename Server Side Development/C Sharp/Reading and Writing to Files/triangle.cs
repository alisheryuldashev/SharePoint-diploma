This C# program displays a table that represents a triangle of any size. 
In triangle, the first and the second rows are set to 1. Each element of 
the triangle (from the third row downward) is the sum of the element directly 
above it and the element to the left of the element directly above it. 
And store the result in a “triangle.txt” file stream.
