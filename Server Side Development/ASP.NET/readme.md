Exercise 2: Here is a Registration Form that uses some validation standard controls in Visual Studio. It has a table-style layout in the Web Form and added server controls to the Web Form with configured basic properties.

The form will display a message "You have not completed all the required fields." //if either of the following fields (i.e. Username, Password, Confirm Password, and Email) //are blank. It will also validate both password and confirm password. //If they are equal then display “Thank you for registering..” otherwise //display a message "Your passwords are not identical."

Exercise 3: This is a student application form where I created a master page and a content page using ASP.NET. It has validators for the  fields and a user control for address section. 

The form saves all entries in a ViewState and assigns it to a GridView control for simple data binding. Ajax partial update for GridView control has been applied for all new entries.
