Here is a simple Registration Form that uses some standard controls in Visual Studio. It has a table-style layout in the Web Form and added server controls to the Web Form with configured basic properties.

The form will display a message "You have not completed all the required fields." //if either of the following fields (i.e. Username, Password, Confirm Password, and Email) //are blank. It will also validate both password and confirm password. //If they are equal then display “Thank you for registering..” otherwise //display a message "Your passwords are not identical."
