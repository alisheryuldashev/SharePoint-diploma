Exercise 1: this exercise creates a SharePoint web part that adds security to the Staff and Student site collections. 
To do that, the code creates a new permission level (Staff permissions) for the Staff site collection. 
Finally, any newly created group in SharePoint programatically inherits permissions granted by the Staff Permissions level.

Exercise 2: The above web part was enhanced by additional functionality: the program can now add or replace user A for user B in any group where use A existed.
