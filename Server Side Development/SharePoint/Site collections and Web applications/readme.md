In this exercise I used SharePoint UI to build an extranet site (ext.hogwarts) by creating a new web application and a site collection. 
Also, two additional site collections were created for internal site (hogwarts) to host staff and students sites.
Finally, a new area for students was created along with a custom list (assignments) and site columns to track grades of assignments and the time the assignments were submitted.
