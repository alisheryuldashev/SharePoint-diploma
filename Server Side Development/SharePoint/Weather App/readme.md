In this assignment we had to build a weather app using REST API calls and deploy it to SharePoint Online. 

We started with the original starter code that was using REST API to showed weather for current location by IP address
Here is what the starter code does:

My implementation: 
Extend the existing starter code by adding a new functionality: 
1. add a textbox to search for a new city 
2. add a search button and build search functionality
3. use a different REST API endpoint to search by city name instead of by IP address
4. Deploy the weather app and create a separate page in SharePoint
