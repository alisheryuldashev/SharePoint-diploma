In this assignment I had to build a weather app using REST API calls and deploy it to SharePoint Online. 

I was given the original starter code (https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/office/Weather-Add-In-for-9635e488) that was using REST API to showed weather for current location by IP address
Here is what the starter code does:

My implementation: 
Extend the existing starter code by adding a new functionality: 
1. add a textbox to search for a new city 
2. add a search button and build search functionality
3. use a different REST API endpoint to search by city name instead of by IP address
4. Deploy the weather app and create a separate page in SharePoint
