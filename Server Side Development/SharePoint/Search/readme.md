This exercise required me to create a custom list of employees with custom columns for names, job titles, about the person, and contact photos.
Then, I created a search and a search results web parts to connect them to my list. 
Finally, I modified the search query to never return a search result for one of the employees. 



This search exercise required to create an enterprise search page (that would look like Bing or Google search) and modify the refiner web part.
