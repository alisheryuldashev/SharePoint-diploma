Exercise 1: the first exercise creates a program using server side object model (SSOM) to populate a SharePoint site collection and individual sites for users based on the list of users file. 

The program will prompt the user to enter a site collection URL, file of user names, and choice of object models to use for this operation (SSOM or CSOM)

Once completed, a new site will also create a new document library called Assignments and two new columns: Submitted and Grade.
