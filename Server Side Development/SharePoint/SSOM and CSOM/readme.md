Exercise 1: the first exercise creates a program using SSOM model to populate a SharePoint site collection and individual sites for users based on the list of users file. 

The program will prompt the user to enter site collection URL, file of user names, and which object model to use for this operation (SSOM or CSOM)

Once completed, a new site will also have a new document library called Assignments with two new columns (Submitted and Grade).
