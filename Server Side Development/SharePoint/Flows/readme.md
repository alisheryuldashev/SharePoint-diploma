In this lab, I created an expense approval system using Microsoft Flow and SharePoint Online in Office 365. 

This demo shows how my flow works in SharePoint Online: 
As soon as you upload a receipt an email will get sent to your manager for approval. 
Once approved or rejected, an approval status will get updated.

Important: Access to the flow details is restricted for privacy reasons. If you are a prospective employer and would like to see it, please contact me for more information.
