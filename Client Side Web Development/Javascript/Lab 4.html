					<h1>Instructions</h1>
					<p>All of these exercises will use this HTML file, and each exercise will use a JavaScript file which is separate, but located in the JS folder inside the same directory as this HTML file</p>
					<ul>
					<li>The file for Exercise 1 is named Exercise1.js</li>
					<li>The file for Exercise 2 is named Exercise2.js</li>
					<li>The file for Exercise 3 is named Exercise3.js</li>
					<li>The file for Exercise 4 is named Exercise4.js</li>
					<li>The file for Challenge 1 is named Challenge1.js</li>

					<h1>Exercise 2: DOM manipulation</h1> 
					<p>Based up an existing codepen.io project, write a JavaScript program that displays a background image initially, and then when the user scrolls the web page, it slowly replaces the image with the text box (using transparency to hide the text box behind an image.) 
					<ul>
						<li>See https://codepen.io for examples of this
							<ul>
								<li><a href="https://codepen.io/dudleystorey/pen/RRwryd" target="_blank">https://codepen.io/dudleystorey/pen/RRwryd</a></li>
								<li>Initially, before you write the JavaScript the image below has text appear above the image, and the image is always shown</li>
								<li>When you take the JavaScript code from the pen and modify it, the image below will act like the code pen does.</li>
								<li>You have to figure out how to change the JavaScript from the pen to make it work on this web page</li>

					<p>In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.
					</p>
					<p>"Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone," he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."
					</p>
					<p>He didn't say any more but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought--frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon--for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.
					</p>
					  <p>And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction — Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament.”— it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No — Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.

					<h1>Exercise 3: Check for Pangram</h1> 
					<p>Write a JavaScript program that takes in a sentence and checks to see if it's a pangram.  A pangram is a sentence which uses every letter of the alphabet at least one.</p>

					<h1>Exercise 4: DOM manipulation</h1> 
					<p>In this exercise, you will be given the table below, and you must write JavaScript that does the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Attach an event listener (onclick) all checkboxes in the table
							<ul><li>Use the document model to find all classes of 'checkme'</li>
							<li>Loop through the returned elements usin a for loop</li>
							<li>Get the value from the Checkbox element</li>
							<li>Use the value to create an ID, and pass it as the parameter to your function</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>That onclick will call your code with the ID of the checkbox (you will get the value you added in your click event sent to your function)</li>
						<li>The code in your checkbox click function will:
							<ol>
								<li>Read the parameter of the checkbox, to locate the row in the table, and add an &lt;input class="qtyval" type=text&gt; that the user can then type in the Quantity of</li>
								<li>Add an event handler to the &lt;input class="qtyval" type=text&gt; that waits until the user changes the value of the textbox, then it calls another function in your JavaScript<.li>
								<li>This 2nd function will find all inputs of class="qtyval" and sum the numbers inside them</li>
								<li>Once it has the sum, it will update the element that has an id of id="totalqty"</li>
						<li>Notice there are no input='button' on this table; everything is done through event handlers</li>
